# 120mm fan mount for 20x20 aluminum extrusion

This is a piece I use for my 3D printer as an electronics cooling fan.
Unfortunately the STLs cannot be included directly on GitHub for size reasons
(the main piece is 24MB).

These were modeled using libfive-studio in Scheme. That program is available
from the AUR as `libfive-studio-git` or from https://github.com/libfive/libfive.
