Documentation for physical projects

I make every effort to include files in open, editable formats for every
project. In most cases, this means that in addition to original Fusion 360
files, STEP files are also published, which can be opened in a free software
CAD program such as FreeCAD. If an additional format is required, please file
an issue on this repository.

All projects in this repository are licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware
License unless otherwise noted in their respective README files. A copy of the
license is available in the file LICENSE in the root directory of this
repository.
