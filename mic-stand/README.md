## 5/8-27 thread microphone stand

I replaced the top section of the microphone stand by Nilz with a 5/8"-27
section, designed in Fusion 360, then glued it all together in Blender. The
threaded section is 0.55" long.

I suggest printing the top threaded section at 0.1mm or smaller layer height.
This can be done with the variable layer height/layer editing function in your
preferred slicer.

The original model this is based on is here:

This model used to be on Thingiverse, but it doesn't let you change your name
so I am simply deleting my account.
